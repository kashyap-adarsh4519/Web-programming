        Chhath Pooja is an ancient Hindu festival dedicated to the worship of the <b>Sun God</b> (<i>Surya</i>) and his consort <em>Chhathi Maiya</em>. 
        It is believed that the origins of this festival date back to the Vedic period, 
        where rituals were performed to honor the Sun for sustaining life on Earth. According to legend, <b>Lord Rama</b> and 
        <b>Goddess Sita</b> performed Chhath Pooja after their return to Ayodhya following their 14-year exile.
